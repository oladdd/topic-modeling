    ### What is Two-Pic Modeling?  
    **Two-Pic Modeling** is an interactive game inspired by **topic modeling**. In topic modeling, algorithms analyze documents and group them by identifying hidden themes. In this game, documents were replaced with **pictures**.  
    Just like words in a document, these images represent abstract ideas, and your goal is to group them into the correct **topic clusters**.

    **Instructions:**  
    - You'll be presented with **two images** side-by-side in each round.
    - Choose the correct **topic cluster** for the images.
    - Each cluster represents a different theme, just like in topic modeling!

    Let‚Äôs begin and see how well you can classify these images! üöÄ
